# TheFriendsGame
Choose one of the friends, the number of opponents you desire (1-5) and battle it out against the other friends.
Each one has a power based on his/her personality which they use to drop the other characters hp down to 0. Other actions include sleep and eat.

My first attempt at a simple game, based on "Friends" series and on a Brackey's tutorial.
